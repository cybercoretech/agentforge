# Plan: P2-M025 — Canonical repository identity on cybercore-tech

Status: Complete
Milestone: P2-M025
Created: 2026-09-23
Owner: AgentForge project

## Goal

Make every repository-owned link, metadata field, and public page point at the new canonical home,
`https://github.com/cybercoretech/agentforge`, with the project site at
`https://cybercoretech.github.io/agentforge/`. Bring the README current with the work completed
since P2-M019 (gates, CI observation, batch launch, daemon fixes, remote-worker foundations).

## Non-goals

- No crate rename, package identity change, or publication (P2-M019 to P2-M022 policy stands).
- No history rewrite; plan and closure records that name `darkstardevx` stay as historical
  evidence.
- No change to the `darkstardevx/agentforge` repository itself. It keeps the history up to
  `976c4f9` and is not configured as a mirror here.
- No workflow logic changes.

## Context

On 2026-09-23 the full history (`976c4f9`, 13 branches) was pushed to the empty
`cybercore-tech/agentforge`. Pages was enabled with workflow builds and deployed successfully, the
repository description and homepage were set, and the local `origin` now points there. P2-M024 was
the first milestone pushed to the new repository. Repository-owned references still point at
`darkstardevx`: `Cargo.toml` `repository`/`homepage`, README badges, links, and clone command, the
Pages site (`site/index.html`, `site/script.js`), `docs/REGISTRY.md`, and the `CHANGELOG.md`
compare links. The README status line still says "P2-M019 registry identity policy complete", and
"What works today" and "Roadmap" predate P1-M004 to P2-M024.

## Architecture placement

Metadata and documentation only: workspace `Cargo.toml`, `site/`, README, CHANGELOG, and docs.

## Data flow

Not applicable; no runtime behavior changes.

## Invariants

- No crate or binary name changes; `cargo package` metadata stays valid.
- The site stays self-contained static HTML/CSS/JS served by the existing Pages workflow.
- Historical records (plans, PROJECT_STATE/AGENT_HANDOFF evidence) are not rewritten.

## ADRs

- ADR-0041: `cybercore-tech/agentforge` is the canonical repository; `darkstardevx/agentforge` is
  the historical location.

## Public API / CLI

None.

## Compatibility analysis

GitHub keeps the old repository available, so existing links keep working. Crate metadata only
changes URLs.

## Dependency analysis

None.

## Expected file boundary

- `.plans/P2-M025-canonical-repository-identity.plan.md`
- `.plans/ACTIVE`
- `Cargo.toml`
- `.cargo/registry-preflight.toml` (amendment 1)
- `site/index.html`
- `site/script.js`
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/REGISTRY.md`
- `docs/RELEASE.md`
- `docs/adr/ADR-0041-canonical-repository.md`
- `docs/MILESTONES.md`
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`

## Amendment 1 — package preflight regression

Running the planned `./scripts/package-preflight` gate failed with "no matching package named
`agentforge-ci` found". The same failure reproduces on `HEAD` without P2-M025 changes.
Classification: dependency/toolchain. P1-M004 and P1-M005 added `agentforge-gate` and
`agentforge-ci` as registry-versioned dependencies of `agentforge-platform`, but the preflight's
`[patch.crates-io]` table in `.cargo/registry-preflight.toml` only lists the internal crates that
existed when P2-M022 wrote it. The preflight is opt-in and not part of CI, so nothing caught it.
Repair: add both crates to the patch table.

## Test-first matrix

- `git grep darkstardevx` outside historical plan/state records returns only intentional
  historical-location notes.
- `cargo metadata` reports the new `repository` and `homepage`.
- `./scripts/package-preflight` still produces and inspects the archive.
- The deployed site links resolve to `cybercore-tech` (checked after the Pages deployment).

## Implementation sequence

1. Commit this draft plan.
2. Approve and activate it in a separate checkpoint.
3. Update metadata, site, README, CHANGELOG, and docs; add ADR-0041.
4. Run the full gate and the package preflight.
5. Push, deploy Pages, verify the live site, record CI evidence, and close.

## Failure modes

- If Pages fails to deploy from the new repository, the previous deployment stays live; classify
  as infrastructure and repair forward.

## Documentation impact

This milestone is documentation: README status, badges, capabilities, roadmap, and docs map;
CHANGELOG unreleased entries; REGISTRY and RELEASE URLs; ADR-0041.

## Quality gates

- `./scripts/gate.sh full`;
- `./scripts/package-preflight`;
- exact-SHA CI green on all seven jobs and a successful Pages deployment from the new repository.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] All repository-owned links and metadata name `cybercore-tech/agentforge`.
- [x] README reflects the current capabilities and roadmap.
- [x] Pages deploys from the new repository with correct links.
- [x] Full local validation and exact-SHA CI evidence are recorded before closure.

## Completion record

Implementation commit: `e840557` (full SHA recorded in PROJECT_STATE.md)
CI run: `35964790564`, `35964797514`, `35964804756`; Pages `35964788019` (all dispatched on
`cybercore-tech/agentforge`)
CI result: green across all seven jobs in all three runs; Pages deployed from the new repository.
Completed: 2026-09-23
Notes:
Repository metadata, README, CHANGELOG, `docs/REGISTRY.md`, and the Pages site now name
`cybercore-tech/agentforge`. Only two intentional notes mention the historical `darkstardevx`
location. `cargo metadata` reports the new repository and homepage. The live site at
`https://cybercoretech.github.io/agentforge/` serves seven links to the new repository in
`index.html` and the new README URL in `script.js`. README "What works today", roadmap, and docs map
now cover P1-M004 to P2-M025, and CHANGELOG Unreleased covers the same span. Amendment 1 repaired
the package preflight regression introduced by P1-M004 and P1-M005 (missing `agentforge-ci` and
`agentforge-gate` patch entries); `./scripts/package-preflight` passes. Push events to the new
repository still do not trigger workflows, so all evidence is from dispatched runs on the same
head. Outside the repository, the Cybercore Wiki gained an AgentForge page (Wiki `97ad157`) and
darknotes gained `Dev/Rust/AgentForge/AgentForge.md` (darknotes `ba52343`).

# AgentForge Project State

## Current release

- Workspace version: `0.3.1`
- Release line: `0.3.x` alpha; `v0.3.1` (P5-M007) is the first release with an attested SBOM and
  the rehearsal's remote-worker fixes. `v0.3.0` (P5-M005) was the first with provenance
  attestations, after `v0.2.0` (P5-M002) and `v0.1.0` (P5-M001).

## Current phase

Self-hosting. AgentForge milestones can now be implemented by a real agent (Claude Code) through
AgentForge itself, with hermetic gates, audited evidence, and operator review. Next candidates: more
agent-built milestones, Phase 4 remote-worker wiring, the P3 tool gateway, and P5 signed releases.

## Active milestone

No active milestone. P3-M006 — external MCP servers behind the gateway — is complete.
`v0.3.1` (P5-M007) is the latest release, and every completed milestone is tagged `milestone/<ID>`.

## Known issues

- Dogfooding finding 23 is open: the audit append lock is unfair and can starve a writer under
  heavy contention (seen once in CI).
- Findings 19 and 20 are released in `v0.3.1`; `v0.3.0` workers still have them.

## P3-M006 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P3-M006-external-mcp-servers.plan.md`.
- Implementation commits: `3939aff` and `de0f0f7`. CI `36213252213` is green on all seven jobs.
- Verified with the real `server-everything` (only mapped tools; `get-env` refused) and a Claude
  Code session calling an external tool through the gateway.

## P5-M007 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M007-release-v0-3-1.plan.md`.
- `v0.3.1` was tagged on `899d3d1` (CI `36210741767` and `36210896132`, rehearsal `36210742242`).
  Tag run `36211060790` published it and verified its own 10 assets, 4 provenance attestations, and
  4 SBOM attestations.
- Verified from this machine (checksums, both attestation types on all archives, the SBOM, and the
  version); the two-host rehearsal against the release passes 18/18.

## P2-M035 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M035-agent-task-hygiene.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `7ba86dc`. CI `36209894691` and `36210058596` are green.

## P5-M006 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M006-sbom-attestation.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `14efd83`, by Claude Code through AgentForge with the MCP gateway. CI
  `36206311396` and `36206485625` are green; rehearsal `36206324690` attested and verified the SBOM
  for 4 archives.

## P4-M012 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M012-two-host-rehearsal.plan.md` (three amendments).
- Implementation commit: `4316279`; GhostPort fix `ebd7639` (v0.1.2). CI `36203766588` and
  `36203932301` are green.
- The rehearsal passes repeatedly (20/20 released; 15/15 twice with this tree), and `--break-heal`
  fails exactly scenario 3. Findings 18–20 are resolved; the released `v0.3.0` still has 19 and 20.

## P4-M011 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M011-worker-host-setup.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `3358a30`. CI `36187573886` and `36187851798` are green; the integration
  test ran on Linux and macOS.
- A live rehearsal through real GhostPort passed the doctor and imported a remote task at its exact
  SHA. The two-machine run now needs only the scripts on each side.

## P5-M005 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M005-release-v0-3-0.plan.md` (one amendment).
- `v0.3.0` was tagged on `c50ed73` (CI `36150323445` and `36150697705`, rehearsal `36150342540`).
  Tag run `36151042612` published it and verified its own assets and 4 attestations.
- https://github.com/cybercoretech/agentforge/releases/tag/v0.3.0 verified from this machine:
  `sha256sum -c` OK, `gh attestation verify --source-ref refs/tags/v0.3.0` OK for all four
  archives, and the binaries report `0.3.0`.

## P5-M004 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M004-keyless-release-provenance.plan.md`.
- Implementation commits: `623be58` and `c228f23` (a test race fixed under Amendment 1). CI
  `36145286790`, `36145728809`, `36146684432`, and `36147102170` are green; release rehearsal
  `36145288186` attested and verified 4 archives.
- Independent local `gh attestation verify` passed (signer `release.yml`, commit `623be58`), and a
  tampered archive failed.

## P3-M005 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P3-M005-mcp-task-tool-gateway.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `9e4cf6f`. CI `36143255345` and `36143670594` are green.
- A real Claude Code session used `task_contract`, `check_changes`, and `run_gate` through the
  bridge, and all three calls are recorded as `ToolInvoked`.

## P4-M010 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M010-remote-worker-visibility-and-supervision.plan.md` (two
  amendments).
- Implementation commits: `32df9a5` and `1a2b3cb`. CI `36111985574` and `36112235466` are green.
- Live: a worker from the unit template rode out a coordinator outage in one process, stopped on
  `unauthorized`, and recovered under systemd; findings 16 and 17 are fixed with regression tests.

## P5-M003 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M003-provable-release-upload.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `8353548`. CI `36107774174` and `36108002066` are green.
- Release rehearsal `36107796647` uploaded nine assets to a draft release, verified them, and
  deleted it; afterwards no draft and no `rehearsal-*` tag remain.

## P0-M015 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P0-M015-wall-clock-audit-timestamps.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `bb1aff6`. CI `36105499481` and `36105880664` are green.
- All 11 production sites stamp at creation, a guard test keeps placeholders out, and the HUD
  shows `at=` and `duration=`. Finding 12 is resolved.

## P4-M009 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M009-worker-host-doctor.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `d003175`. CI `36104260988` and `36104451697` are green.
- The doctor covers every P0-M014 setup step, and `run` refuses on failure; findings 13 and 14 are
  resolved.

## P2-M034 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M034-closure-and-docs-integrity.plan.md`; the ADR-0044 addendum.
- Implementation commit: `7023c50`. CI `36102686579` and `36102872926` are green, and both new
  checks ran there.
- Tagger: the incident replay is refused, and all 69 tags are unchanged (P2-M017 is reported under
  the pre-P2-M034 rule). The ADR registry is complete (51) and the docs map is complete, both
  enforced.

## P0-M014 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P0-M014-eintr-safe-pipe-readers.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `dec91f2`, by Claude Code as remote worker `remote-dogfood` over GhostPort,
  imported at its exact SHA, with the coordinator `workspace` gate 1/1, then integrated. CI
  `36100473858` and `36100635646` are green.
- The run log and findings 12 to 14 are in `docs/DOGFOODING.md`.

## P5-M002 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M002-release-v0-2-0.plan.md` (three amendments).
- `v0.2.0` was tagged on `991eb60` (CI `36097122882` and `36097287895`). The tag run's publish step
  failed on staging directories, so the release was published from that run's artifacts. The
  workflow was fixed in `46d8480` (dry run `36098172256`), and the test flake in `84df7f9` (CI
  `36098488170`, `36098648215`, and `36098655755`).
- https://github.com/cybercoretech/agentforge/releases/tag/v0.2.0 verified with a plain
  `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`, and the binaries report `0.2.0`.

## P4-M008 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M008-remote-execution.plan.md`; ADR-0051.
- Implementation commit: `42eb636`. CI `36095220162`, `36095589777`, and `36095597117` are green on
  all seven jobs.
- Through GhostPort v0.1.1, remote commit `211563f` was imported at its exact SHA, gated on the
  coordinator, and integrated onto `main`.

## P4-M007 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M007-remote-worker-channel.plan.md`; ADR-0050.
- Implementation commits: `ac71c1b` and `d0797da`. CI `36092464428`, `36092602029`, and
  `36092609574` are green on all seven jobs.
- Real GhostPort v0.1.1 verification: operations through the tunnel, an impostor key rejected, a
  wrong secret refused, and only ciphertext on the data path.

## P4-M006 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M006-auto-dispatch.plan.md`; ADR-0049.
- Implementation commit: `23db2a0`. CI `36081432343`, `36081582250`, and `36081590100` are green on
  all seven jobs.
- Dogfood: with `forged`, a polling worker, and a policy, a newly created task was dispatched, run,
  and released with no grant command.

## P4-M005 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M005-same-host-worker.plan.md`; ADR-0048.
- Implementation commit: `07dd1b8`. CI `36029313163`, `36029663704`, and `36029677648` are green on
  all seven jobs.
- Dogfood: a background `forge worker run` claimed a granted lease, ran the task, and released it,
  in one audit chain.

## P0-M013 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P0-M013-coordinated-audit-appends.plan.md` (Amendment 1); ADR-0047.
- Implementation commits: `89be554` and `e559f02` (Windows delete-pending lock contention). CI
  `36027216240`, `36027530893`, and `36027544754` on `e559f02` are green on all seven jobs.
- The corruption was reproduced on the old code before the fix. A threaded stress test and a
  three-process CLI test keep one verified chain.

## P4-M004 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M004-lease-operations.plan.md` (Amendment 1); ADR-0046.
- Implementation commit: `b3b816e`. CI `36023401117` (push), `36023737955`, and `36023749957` are
  green on all seven jobs.
- Live-daemon dogfood: a leased task was refused, `forged` expired the lease on its own, and the
  launch then succeeded.

## P1-M008 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M008-post-review-approvals.plan.md`; ADR-0045.
- Implementation commit: `f066697`. CI `36020725173` (push) and `36020936985` (dispatched) are
  green on all seven jobs.
- Scratch-repo dogfood with the real binaries: a late commit after approval was refused, and
  integration fast-forwarded exactly the re-approved head.

## P5-M001 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P5-M001-first-release-v0-1-0.plan.md` (three amendments).
- Release commit `b1f1cab`, tagged `v0.1.0`: CI `36012325272` and `36012648916` green, and packaging
  dry run `36012653332`.
- Release: https://github.com/cybercoretech/agentforge/releases/tag/v0.1.0. Four archives with
  `.sha256` files and `SHA256SUMS`. A downloaded Linux binary verified and reports `0.1.0`.
- The tag run `36013033041` built every target, but its publish job failed (no checkout, so `gh`
  had no repository). It was published from that run's artifacts. The workflow is fixed in
  `0eb777b` (CI `36013626245`, dry run `36013843718`).

## P2-M033 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M033-hud-agent-runs.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `29484bc`, written by Claude Code (task `P2-M033-T0001`, 252 s, gates
  1/1) and integrated with `forge task integrate --target main`.
- CI `36010816304` (push) and `36011038882` (dispatched) are green on all seven jobs.

## P2-M032 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M032-macos-daemon-stop-flake.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `e3c4bbe`. The daemon client treats macOS `EINVAL` on a reset socket as
  transport loss.
- CI `36006696921` (push) and dispatched `36006725709`, `36006735861`, and `36006745329` are green on
  all seven jobs, including macOS 14.

## P2-M031 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M031-tagger-closure-detection.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `12796ef`. Closure detection now uses the plan status line and verifies it
  before tagging.
- CI: `36005319580`, `36005682117`, and `36005691600` are green. `36005350819` failed only on the
  unrelated macOS flake above.
- `milestone/P2-M030` was recreated on `fa0672c`; the erroneous draft tag's deletion is recorded in
  the ADR-0044 addendum.

## P2-M030 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M030-milestone-tags.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `94b9843` (`scripts/tag-milestone`, CI self-test, closure-step docs,
  ADR-0044).
- CI `36004473648` (push) and `36004535524` (dispatched) are green on all seven jobs.
- Backfill: 55 tags created, pushed, and verified against the remote. No release run was triggered.

## P2-M029 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M029-agent-run-visibility.plan.md` (amendment 1).
- Implementation commits: `9e06c07` and `7e5c0c0` (portable evidence paths after a Windows-only
  failure in the first CI pair).
- CI `35971863878` (push) and `35971879237` (dispatched) are green on all seven jobs.

## P2-M027 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M027-real-agent-bridge.plan.md`.
- Bridge commit: `cabcc1c` (`scripts/agents/claude-code-bridge`, CI self-test step, docs,
  ADR-0043).
- Proof: P1-M007 was implemented by Claude Code through AgentForge (`6131508`), and its CI is green.
- Seven dogfooding findings are recorded in `docs/DOGFOODING.md`: two fixed by P2-M028, one by the
  P1-M007 amendment, two scheduled as P2-M029, and one kept as operator guidance.

## P1-M007 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M007-task-required-gates.plan.md` (Amendment 1).
- Implementation commit: `6131508`, authored through task `P1-M007-T0003` (Claude Code via
  `scripts/agents/claude-code-bridge`, 321 s; pre-commit gate and project gate passed).
- CI `35970854736` (push) and `35970861705` (dispatched) are green on all seven jobs.
- Landed by an operator fast-forward after review, because the task lacked merge authority. The
  full run log and findings are in `docs/DOGFOODING.md`.

## P2-M028 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M028-hermetic-gate-under-hooks.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `2ffd59d`.
- CI `35969105365` (push-triggered) and `35969113717` (dispatched) are green on all seven jobs.
- The incident was reproduced in a disposable clone before the fix and disproven after it; see the
  plan's completion record and `docs/DOGFOODING.md`.


## P2-M025 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M025-canonical-repository-identity.plan.md` (one amendment).
- Implementation commit: `e84055726e6ab739dd1635c5a01a22c2dbd87cbf`.
- Dispatched CI on `e840557`: `35964790564`, `35964797514`, and `35964804756` are green across all
  seven jobs; Pages run `35964788019` deployed the updated site, and the live site links to the new
  repository.
- Metadata, README (status, capabilities, roadmap, docs map), CHANGELOG, registry docs, and the site
  now name the canonical repository. The package preflight regression from P1-M004/P1-M005 is
  repaired.
- External docs: Cybercore Wiki AgentForge page (`97ad157`) and darknotes note
  `Dev/Rust/AgentForge/AgentForge.md` (`ba52343`).

## P2-M024 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M024-daemon-long-running-requests.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `5ef03f18715c95fed2b1a6b6e3720e9537bd3dac`.
- Exact CI on `5ef03f1` (dispatched on `cybercoretech/agentforge`): `35964099187`, `35964105073`,
  and `35964110929` are green across all seven jobs.
- Daemon executions no longer use the 2-second control timeout: keepalive frames, a single execution
  slot, `BUSY` for overlapping executions and mid-run stop, and `ExecutionInterrupted` instead of the
  misleading stale-metadata advice. ADR-0040 records the decision.

## P1-M006 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M006-concurrent-batch-launch.plan.md` (one amendment).
- Implementation commit: `b54f47acbd01ac1fb40da3302cb53b02fbeefda3`.
- Exact CI on `b54f47a`: push run `35962553757` and dispatched repeats `35962575356`,
  `35962581675`, and `35962587949` are green across all seven jobs.
- `forge task launch-batch` runs disjoint ready tasks concurrently under a single state
  coordinator and defers overlapping, running-overlap, and over-limit tasks deterministically.
  Rendezvous fixtures prove concurrency on all three platforms.

## P1-M005 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M005-ci-observation-wiring.plan.md` (one amendment).
- Implementation commit: `f1edf54ec0a473e73df2a3006cd50c80315b72dd`.
- Exact CI on `f1edf54`: push run `35962029748` and dispatched repeats `35962047802` and
  `35962053963` are green across all seven jobs.
- `forge ci observe` records `CiObserved` plus `FailureClassified(stage=ci)` per failed job. It
  never changes task state. `scripts/ci-provider-github` is the opt-in GitHub reference provider.
- Dogfooding against this repository classified the MSRV failure in run `35960725620` as
  `semantic_test`.

## P1-M004 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M004-orchestrated-gate-evidence.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `aa307468b8ba354a2e24426d1a16949e179e4dd7`.
- Exact CI on `aa30746`: push run `35961539333` and dispatched repeats `35961557663` and
  `35961562338` are green across all seven jobs.
- Gates are reviewed `.forge/gates/<id>.conf` profiles. They are validated before the task runs,
  execute in the task worktree after a successful agent, and produce `GateFinished` audit
  evidence. Any failure transitions the task to `failed` with `FailureClassified(stage=gates)`.
- `forge gate list`, per-gate CLI output with a non-zero exit on failure, and daemon gate
  summaries are available. ADR-0037 records the decision.

## P2-M023 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M023-bounded-daemon-lifecycle-tests.plan.md` (two amendments).
- Implementation commits: `1eb3b0f`, `4f5a45e`, `29bc8041e81e9f8994e125e4405d0c0338f004cf`.
- Exact CI on `29bc804`: push run `35961283620` and dispatched repeats `35961301835`,
  `35961306212`, `35961310768`, `35961315829` are all green across all seven jobs.
- Root cause of the six-hour Windows cancellations (`35697199910` and three earlier runs): a fixed
  500 ms readiness poll followed by an unbounded join on a daemon that had started successfully.
  It reproduced locally with a slowed `git` and is fixed with deadline-based readiness and
  bounded joins.
- The daemon now bounds each accepted request read, so a stalled client cannot block `stop`.
  `stop` waits for both endpoint and lock removal and tolerates Windows delete-pending
  `Access is denied`. Multi-test fixtures use collision-free temporary roots.
- P4-M001 to P4-M003 had no exact-SHA CI of their own. Their code is included in every green run
  above.

## P4-M003 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M003-remote-dispatch-planning.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `ba06cc0c77c187c4ca63f8735f3e507603e4d6af`.
- Local `./scripts/gate.sh full` passed for implementation and closure checkpoints, including
  formatting, repository validation, plan policy, workspace Clippy, tests, and documentation tests.
- `agentforge-scheduler::plan_remote_dispatch` now provides canonical task/worker ordering,
  readiness and path-ownership checks, explicit expiry observation, capacity-aware assignment,
  lease-generation evidence, and all-or-nothing lease-book mutation.
- Eight focused scheduler tests cover deterministic assignment, readiness, conflicts, capacity,
  expiry/reclaim, generation advancement, duplicate inputs, and failure atomicity.
- No network, process, daemon, CLI, authentication, persistence, cloud mutation, or remote
  execution authority was introduced. No remote CI run was requested.

## P4-M002 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M002-durable-worker-lease-state.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `82626529ff5cdb6ae0d63aeafa43c2fa0490a143`.
- Local `./scripts/gate.sh full` passed for implementation and closure checkpoints, including
  formatting, repository validation, plan policy, workspace Clippy, tests, and documentation tests.
- `agentforge-state` now provides a separate checksummed, bounded, atomically replaced
  `.forge/state/remote-leases.snapshot` through `LeaseStore`/`FileLeaseStore`.
- Restart recovery is explicit and clock-free during load: `load -> expire_due(observed_at_ms) ->
  continue`; active ownership, generations, timestamps, and terminal states are preserved.
- Corruption, incompatible versions, bounds violations, invalid identities/tags/generations,
  duplicate active tasks, truncation, and trailing bytes fail closed. Task snapshots remain
  independent.
- No network, daemon protocol, CLI, authentication, cloud mutation, or remote execution authority
  was introduced. No remote CI run was requested.

## P4-M001 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P4-M001-remote-worker-lease-contract.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `2027608`.
- Local `./scripts/gate.sh full` passed for the implementation checkpoint and closure checkpoint,
  including formatting, repository validation, plan policy, workspace Clippy, tests, and
  documentation tests.
- The focused `agentforge-core` suite passed 29 tests covering descriptor validation, deterministic
  capabilities, lease exclusivity, concurrency limits, owner/generation checks, bounded renewal,
  explicit expiry, release, and reclaim.
- No network, cloud mutation, remote command execution, persistence, secret, or authentication
  authority was introduced.

## P3-M001 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P3-M001-cybercore-mission-control-foundation.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `07eafdf5851b32b92a392d7ab9f2465f71f5e860` in the standalone
  `cybercore-mission-control` repository; remote `main` resolves to the exact SHA.
- TypeScript validation passed with Cloudflare Workers Types `5.20260921.1`.
- Wrangler `4.135.0` dry-run recognized the Worker, static assets, D1 binding, and
  `ProjectEventChannel` Durable Object.
- Local D1 migration `0001_initial.sql` applied successfully.
- Runtime/API smoke passed for health, dashboard assets, admin authorization, project creation,
  agent registration, authenticated heartbeat persistence, durable audit evidence, and duplicate
  nonce rejection.
- No production Cloudflare deployment or credential was used.

## P3-M002 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P3-M002-cybercore-rust-local-connector.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `5da61c73e729d245edc356047353c2bd82842fcc` in the standalone
  `cybercore-mission-control` repository; remote `main` resolves to the exact SHA.
- Locked offline Rust formatting, check, test, and Clippy gates passed; seven connector tests cover
  protocol shape, credential redaction, bounds, retries, and cooperative shutdown.
- Exact GitHub Actions run `35599020205` is green for the implementation SHA, including Worker
  TypeScript and Rust connector jobs.
- No production deployment or real operator credential was used. The connector is outbound-only,
  observation-only, and explicitly experimental.

## P3-M003 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P3-M003-cybercore-release-hardening.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `781590ce3769aacda21d95db267ca74d91022dfe` in the standalone
  `cybercore-mission-control` repository; remote `main` resolves to the exact SHA.
- Locked Rust format/check/test/Clippy gates passed; the inspected Cargo archive contains the MIT
  license and intended package files without local configuration or credentials.
- Exact GitHub Actions run `35601172176` is green across Ubuntu, macOS, Windows, and Worker
  TypeScript; GitHub accepted the tag-gated release workflow definition.
- No release tag, production deployment, crate publication, or real operator credential was used.

## P3-M004 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P3-M004-mission-control-production-readiness.plan.md`.
- Standalone implementation sequence: `48863e8`, `d2029f1`, `c5d92b4`, `9533c51`, `e9b76c3`, and
  `4a435c1c6ac90f78986aa39c04235dae6552d8aa`; standalone `main` resolves to the final SHA.
- Exact standalone CI runs `35608217415`, `35611397659`, `35612605311`, and `35614113529` are
  green for their corresponding implementation heads; the final run covers Worker TypeScript,
  preflight/protocol checks, staging binding dry-run, and Ubuntu/macOS/Windows Rust connector jobs.
- Local disposable validation covered migration, registration, authenticated heartbeat, durable
  audit, authenticated live event delivery, malformed/stale/future/oversized input rejection,
  credential/project-scope failures, replay rejection, and Rust package gates.
- A manually confirmed staging-only dry-run workflow is present. Automatic CI deliberately excludes
  the long-lived local Wrangler process after repeated CI-only lifecycle hangs; the same smoke passes
  in a clean local checkout and remains operator-runnable via `npm run smoke:local`.
- No Cloudflare deployment, production credential, real account ID, or remote command authority was
  used; Mission Control remains observation-only and AgentForge remains the local authority.
- AgentForge closure commit: `571c8d26724b479ca2e9e0019ca4a31b240d8744`; exact CI `35621709316`
  and Pages deployment `35621709313` are green for that closure SHA.

P2-M022 prepared `agentforge-platform` for a future registry decision without publishing anything.
The package now has complete metadata, explicit registry version requirements beside local paths,
and an opt-in offline archive preflight. Internal crates remain private; normal registry resolution
continues to fail closed until a separate approved publication-order decision.

## P2-M022 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M022-cargo-publishability-preparation.plan.md`.
- Plan-boundary amendment: `00e7b5c`.
- Implementation commit: `5027f3b7d289d4efb07bbd6d768062ea82632147`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35569143760` — all seven jobs green, including Windows.
- Package preflight: 16-file `agentforge-platform-0.0.1` archive created and inspected locally.
- Normal offline package resolution remains intentionally blocked by unpublished internal crates.

P2-M021 isolated the Windows daemon lifecycle integration harness after repeated exact-head CI
runs showed concurrent foreground daemon tests hanging while the spawned restart test passed. The
daemon lifecycle assertions remain unchanged; only the test-binary lifecycle ownership is
serialized.

## P2-M021 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M021-windows-daemon-ci-reliability.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `97401eb712923acf08c88b0c09a3cc830daad928`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35567104109` — all seven jobs green, including Windows.
- Twenty repeated local parallel daemon-test runs and the full local gate passed.

The end-user workspace package is named `agentforge-platform`. All workspace crates remain private
(`publish = false`); GitHub binary archives, `forge`/`forged`, internal crate names, and runtime
behavior remain unchanged. A future publishability plan is still required before any registry
publication.

## P2-M020 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M020-agentforge-platform-package-identity.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `02cf453ab778c4c2aa9e44d0c83d9378b8ac142e`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35562749505` — rerun green across repository policy, stable, MSRV,
  CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows after the initial macOS temporary-root collision.
- Closure commit: `6ff27045a32c22d8910f48cd07ef70e086f50f94`.
- Closure CI evidence: `35565106069` — repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, and
  macOS green; Windows reproduced the known daemon teardown `PermissionDenied (Access is denied.)`
  infrastructure failure. No package-identity regression was observed.

## P2-M019 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M019-registry-identity-and-distribution-policy.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `caa37debdd89ea6035723749b52db7a02fba081d`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35559168897` — all seven jobs green across repository policy, stable,
  MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- Closure commit: `b4d7f7c90b72154b81306f289b872e2d8f1cf248`.
- Exact closure CI: `35559471908` attempt 2 — all seven jobs green after the initial Windows daemon
  teardown infrastructure failure passed on the failed-job rerun.
- The registry guide, release policy, README warning, and ADR-0031 now distinguish AgentForge from
  occupied crates.io identities and preserve the GitHub binary distribution boundary.

  green, with the deployment environment URL expression validated on the repaired SHA.
- Pages workflow repair closure: `24d1571`; exact CI `35554451233` and Pages deployment
  `35554451229` are green for the exact closure SHA.
- The public site is live at `https://cybercoretech.github.io/agentforge/`. It is dependency-free,
  responsive, keyboard-accessible, reduced-motion aware, and keeps the alpha/pre-release warning
  visible. The repository and its durable evidence remain authoritative.

## P2-M016 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M016-daemon-task-launch-parity.plan.md`.
- Implementation commits: `b8eaff7`, `e92d9e7` (portable Windows protocol-fixture repair).
- Exact implementation CI: `35551842104` — final rerun green across repository policy, stable,
  MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows. The initial macOS failure was classified as an
  unrelated temporary-root collision in an existing intake test and passed on the failed-job rerun.
- Closure commit: `63513a6`.
- Exact closure CI: `35552143595` — all seven jobs green across repository policy, stable, MSRV,
  CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- `forge daemon launch` now prepares or verifies the deterministic managed worktree through the
  existing P2-M015 orchestration seam, records a durable observation, and executes through the
  bounded persisted process path for direct executables and named profiles. Existing
  `forge daemon run` behavior remains compatible and explicit; acceptance, review, integration,
  and retirement remain independent operator actions.

## P2-M015 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M015-real-project-orchestration-pilot.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `8992da820162e3bd410841dd8eeddd8e5f04a935`.

  MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- Closure commit: `5ce50c9`.
- Exact closure CI: `35550083171` — all seven jobs green across repository policy, stable, MSRV,
  CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- The foreground `forge task launch` path validates task readiness, capabilities, approvals, and
  adapter configuration before resolving an exact base and creating or reusing the deterministic
  managed worktree. It records durable worktree observation evidence, delegates to the existing
  bounded process path, and leaves acceptance, review, integration, and retirement explicit.

## P2-M014 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M014-safe-review-integration.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `b0cbdc810a1835c9f27d9c064cd6646334fc4897`.

- Exact closure CI: `35548238497` — all seven jobs green across repository policy, stable, MSRV,
  CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows; the Windows teardown failure was classified as
  infrastructure/flaky and passed on the failed-job rerun.
- The operator workflow now provides bounded read-only task diffs and explicit approved integration
  through a serialized, fast-forward-only path. Integration verifies task state, capability,
  approval, ownership, cleanliness, target ancestry, and exact heads; it records durable evidence,
  is idempotent, and preserves the source branch and worktree for explicit retirement.

## P2-M013 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M013-pty-foreground-agent-sessions.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `c9809205cf5f5851b00d957332a35f732392ab66`.

- Exact closure CI: `35545183120` — all seven jobs green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI
  smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- The direct `forge run` path now offers explicit `--interactive --pty` sessions backed by a native
  PTY, raw keyboard input, resize forwarding, bounded live evidence, fail-closed non-TTY checks,
  and cooperative child cleanup. Captured, cooked-interactive, and detached daemon behavior remain
  unchanged.

## P2-M012 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M012-interactive-foreground-agent-sessions.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `4fa5c0d2c00887b5de70e6bcf43ed752e8202936`.

  smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- Closure commit: `3969de7a70b638dce6d4d4eddef0052e49a27f88`; exact closure CI `35530354301` is
  green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- `forge run` now supports opt-in cooked line-oriented `--interactive` sessions that stream child
  output while retaining bounded evidence; captured runs and detached daemon execution remain
  unchanged, and successful tasks still require independent acceptance.

## P2-M011 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M011-guided-intake-operator-hardening.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `7b40c0a83cf022d66462270d4d4ca6fc66c40975`.

  green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- The guided intake CLI now accepts bounded UTF-8 `--input-file` sessions through the same prompt,
  preview, confirmation, validation, and rollback engine as stdin; disposable tests verify the
  intake-to-task-inspect/HUD handoff and fail-closed malformed or oversized inputs.

## P2-M010 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M010-guided-project-intake.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `5533454d0d1fb75129b675e61569931a685b934a`.

  green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- The guided `forge intake` flow now previews and confirms bounded blueprint/guideline edits,
  detects concurrent source changes, and can persist an explicit task draft through existing task
  validation and snapshot boundaries.

## P2-M008 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M008-windows-dogfooding-parity.plan.md`.

  platforms.
- Portable worktree lifecycle tests now compare canonical roots and run on every platform matrix
  host; daemon CLI dogfooding uses a direct Rust executable fixture without shell interpolation.

## P2-M009 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M009-daemon-audit-sequence-continuation.plan.md`.
- Implementation commit: `d4d17cd`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35527442420` — all jobs green across repository policy, stable, MSRV,
  CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- Closure commit: `59c5934`; exact closure CI `35527646923` is green across repository policy,
  stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
- Persisted execution now seeds each attempt audit with the verified sequence and digest tail;
  preflight failures remain side-effect free.
- Real Omniscient dogfooding appended records `#6–#8` after the existing audit tail; the no-op task
  was cancelled and its clean worktree retired with its branch preserved.

## P2-M007 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M007-cross-platform-agent-operations.plan.md`.
- Implementation commits: `0153810`, `11c6b32`, `11ea7e7`, `4c33f2f`, `2144aa7`, `f963e17`,

## Current capability

AgentForge now has:

- provider-neutral governance and durable task-state foundations;
- deterministic task-owned branches and managed worktree paths;
- exact base-commit resolution;
- Git porcelain-based worktree discovery;
- task, path, and branch ownership verification;
- deterministic managed-only listing;
- dirty-state and unresolved-operation detection;
- safe non-forced worktree creation and retirement;
- preserved task branches after retirement;
- direct Git argument passing without shell interpolation;
- no routine forced removal, `git clean`, or `git reset --hard`;
- isolated temporary-repository integration coverage;
- Rust 1.85.0 compatibility without external Rust dependencies.

AgentForge can now invoke an explicitly configured local coding-agent executable in a verified task
worktree through a provider-neutral interface, either directly or through the optional bounded
loopback `forged` service. Execution evidence is bounded and remains separate from task acceptance.
It can also run direct, explicit local gates with cleared child environments,
bounded raw evidence, deadlines, and ordered batch reports. Scheduling, CI failure automation,
and deployment orchestration remain intentionally unimplemented. Operators can now
read a deterministic, bounded HUD snapshot of intake, task, audit, and managed worktree state.
Operators can also inspect tasks, record explicit required approvals, and apply audited accept,
cancel, and retry transitions through `forge task`. `forge run` consumes only verified, task-linked
approval evidence; HUD and watch mode remain read-only.
The repository now declares its MIT license and `0.0.x` versioning policy, packages tagged/manual
binary archives with checksums, and validates portable workspace behavior on Linux, macOS, and
Windows. Persisted daemon runs continue verified audit chains without changing the audit format.

## P2-M003 completion evidence

- Documentation closure commit: `907913d424148506aa8f1a3704aa89b895ea7658`.
- Closure/mainline CI: `35498226882` — all four jobs green for that exact closure SHA.

## Next planned milestone

None. Future work should be scoped from observed operator usage and approved before implementation.

## Known blockers

Artifact signing and provenance attestations remain future work. Windows Git verbatim temporary-path
handling and worktree-backed dogfooding are covered by the completed P2-M007 and P2-M008 evidence.

## P2-M002 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M002-interactive-hud.plan.md`.
- Implementation head: `11792769304f8042235146d670eb554b0bc0cde3`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35497283972` — all four jobs green.
- The HUD now supports bounded cooked-mode watch operation with refresh/help/quit commands and
  recoverable, read-only source diagnostics.

## P2-M001 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P2-M001-operator-hud.plan.md`.
- Implementation head: `ca741baeda2fd040e6df714f9d2c3af18d16ba76`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35496675009` — all four jobs green.
- The HUD now provides a read-only, bounded, deterministic report and fail-closed source diagnostics
  through `forge hud <root>`.

## P1-M003 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M003-project-intake.plan.md`.
- Implementation head: `987b971a05ae7ef74b4e9da8cb486b9f0b597260`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35495846139` — all four jobs green.
- The intake path now provides non-overwriting initialization, bounded versioned blueprint and
  guideline validation, explicit task creation, durable snapshot writes, and CLI integration tests.

## P1-M002 completion evidence

- Approved plan: `.plans/P1-M002-orchestration-loop.plan.md`.
- Implementation head: `0dcd50d08b8fcec9c25a9ab13f3567e2f50209cd`.
- Exact implementation CI: `35494859218` — all four jobs green.
- The persisted single-task loop validates task state and policy, executes a bounded local process
  through the adapter, records durable task/audit transitions, and exposes `forge run`.
- Successful executions remain `Running` pending independent acceptance; failed-state persistence is
  a known follow-up gap for the next implementation increment.

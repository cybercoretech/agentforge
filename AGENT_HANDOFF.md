# AgentForge Agent Handoff

## Repository state

- Active milestone: none. P3-M006 is complete (`3939aff`, `de0f0f7`): external MCP servers go in
  `.forge/mcp/<server>.conf` with `tool.<name>=<capability>` lines (unmapped means invisible); see
  `docs/MCP_GATEWAY.md`. Finding 23 (the audit lock can starve a writer) is open.
- P5-M007 is complete: **`v0.3.1` is published** (tag on `899d3d1`), the
  first release with an attested SBOM and the remote-worker fixes. `scripts/rehearse-two-hosts`
  now defaults to it.
- P2-M035 is complete (`7ba86dc`): findings 21 and 22 are resolved. Task
  creation refuses the merge approval without the capability, and the bridge lets
  `run_local_commands` agents run files in their allowed paths.
- P5-M006 is complete (`14efd83`, agent-built): releases carry an attested
  CycloneDX SBOM (`scripts/sbom-merge`, ADR-0054). **When creating an agent task that must be
  integrated, give it `--capability merge_protected_branch` as well as the approval** (finding 21).
  The agent cannot run project scripts (finding 22), so run them in review.
- P4-M012 is complete (`4316279`): run `scripts/rehearse-two-hosts` (with
  `--forge-archive` for a build under test) after any change to the remote-worker path. Remote
  workers need **GhostPort ≥ 0.1.2**. A claim now restarts the lease window, and a lost `RESULT` is
  retried (findings 19 and 20; not yet released).
- P4-M011 is complete (`3358a30`): for the two-machine run, use
  `scripts/worker-bundle` on the coordinator and `scripts/worker-host-setup` on the worker host
  (REMOTE_WORKERS.md). **When rehearsing under a scratch `HOME`, also unset `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`**, or
  the files land in the real config.
- P5-M005 is complete: **`v0.3.0` is published** (tag on `c50ed73`). It is
  the first attested release, and the first real tag the workflow published by itself.
  `xtask validate` now requires a `.cargo/registry-preflight.toml` patch entry for every internal
  crate the CLI depends on: add one with any new crate.
- P5-M004 is complete (`623be58`): release archives are attested
  keylessly (`actions/attest@v4`, ADR-0053), and `publish-release` verifies the uploaded assets'
  attestations. There are no signing keys to manage. The next `vX.Y.Z` tag is the first attested
  release.
- P3-M005 is complete (`9e4cf6f`): `forge mcp serve` is the MCP
  task-tool gateway (`docs/MCP_GATEWAY.md`, ADR-0052). Give a task `use_mcp_tools` (plus
  `read_repository` / `run_local_commands`) and the bridge profile `--forge`. `serde_json` is
  allowed **only** in `agentforge-mcp`; ask before using it elsewhere.
- P4-M010 is complete (`32df9a5`, `1a2b3cb`): `forge hud` shows workers
  and leases; remote workers retry an unreachable coordinator and stop on refusals; see
  `contrib/systemd/` and `docs/REMOTE_WORKERS.md#running-a-worker-unattended`. **`forged` logs
  through `crate::log`, never `eprintln!`** (a started daemon's stderr is a file, but logging must
  never be able to panic a thread; finding 16). Remote-worker attempts are archived under
  `agentforge/remote/<lease>` in the worker's clone (finding 17).
- P5-M003 is complete (`8353548`): **before tagging a release after any
  release-workflow change, dispatch `release.yml` on `main`**. It rehearses the upload into a
  draft release, verifies it, and deletes it (`docs/RELEASE.md`). The release upload is no longer
  an unproven step.
- P0-M015 is complete (`bb1aff6`): audit events carry wall-clock times.
  **Create audit events with `AuditEvent::now`, never `new`, in production code** (a guard test
  enforces it). All P0-M014 findings (11 to 15) are resolved.
- P4-M009 is complete (`d003175`): `forge worker remote doctor` and the
  `run` preflight. Run the doctor on any new worker host. Open: finding 12 (audit timestamps), next.
- P2-M034 is complete (`7023c50`): the tagger decides only from `HEAD`
  and refuses uncommitted or unclosed milestones; `xtask validate` enforces the ADR registry and
  README docs map. **When you add an ADR or a doc, add its registry row or README link in the same
  commit, or the gate fails.** Open findings: 12, 13, and 14.
- P0-M014 is complete: the **first real-agent remote run** (`dec91f2`, by
  Claude Code over GhostPort, exact-SHA import, integrated). New open findings: 12 (no wall-clock
  audit timestamps), 13 (no remote renewal report), 14 (unchecked worker-host setup). These are the
  candidates for the next milestone.
- P5-M002 is complete: **`v0.2.0` is published** (tag on `991eb60`). Its
  publish step failed a second time (staging directories); the release was published via
  recovery, and the workflow was fixed in `46d8480`. Dispatched dry runs now exercise the publish
  job except the upload. (Superseded by P5-M003: dispatch now rehearses the upload too.)
  Open: finding 11 (EINTR in pipe readers). Next planned: a real-agent remote-worker dogfood.
- P4-M008 is complete (`42eb636`; CI `36095220162`, `36095589777`, and
  `36095597117`). Remote execution: `forge worker remote run --repo`, then RESULT with a bundle,
  then `import_remote_result` (exact SHA, ancestry, path boundary, local gates, slot-serialized).
  Phase 4's remote-execution path is complete end to end.
- P4-M007 is complete (`ac71c1b` and `d0797da`; CI `36092464428`,
  `36092602029`, and `36092609574`). Remote workers use `forge worker enroll`, the loopback AFW1
  API from `.forge/worker-api.conf`, and `forge worker remote` through GhostPort; the recipe is in
  REMOTE_WORKERS. Next: P4-M008, remote execution with a git-bundle result and exact-SHA import.
- P4-M006 is complete (`23db2a0`; CI `36081432343`, `36081582250`, and
  `36081590100`). `.forge/dispatch.conf` (opt-in and milestone-scoped) lets forged or `forge lease
  dispatch` grant ready, approved tasks to workers, once per task. Next P4 candidates: authenticated
  transport for workers on other hosts (GhostPort) and exact-SHA acceptance of their results.
- P4-M005 is complete (`07dd1b8`; CI `36029313163`, `36029663704`, and
  `36029677648`). `forge worker run` runs leased tasks for their exact holder: claim, launch, renew,
  release. Next P4 candidates: daemon auto-dispatch of ready tasks to idle workers, then an
  authenticated transport (GhostPort) and exact-SHA acceptance of remote results.
- P0-M013 is complete (`89be554` and `e559f02`; CI `36027216240`,
  `36027530893`, and `36027544754`). Audit appends are locked, refresh, and renumber, so multiple
  writers are safe. Attempt logs use `append_batch`. Operator actions create the audit log on first
  use. Next: P4-M005, the same-host worker process.
- P4-M004 is complete (`b3b816e`; CI `36023401117`, `36023737955`, and
  `36023749957`). Leases are operable: `.forge/workers/*.conf`, `forge lease ...`, a local-run
  guard, and the daemon sweep. Open findings 9 (audit append coordination) and 10 (no audit log on a
  fresh project) are good small next milestones, and they come before the P4 worker process.
- P1-M008 is complete (`f066697`; CI `36020725173` and `36020936985`). **New
  integration order:** diff → accept → `task approve ... merge_protected_branch` (bound to the
  head; never before launch) → integrate. A branch that moves after approval must be approved
  again.
- P5-M001 is complete: **`v0.1.0` is published** from `b1f1cab`. The first
  tag run's publish job failed on a workflow defect, fixed in `0eb777b`; see `docs/RELEASE.md` "If
  the publish job fails". The next release tag is the first to exercise the fixed publish job, so
  watch it. Release tags (`vX.Y.Z`) are separate from `milestone/<ID>` tags.
- P2-M033 (HUD view of agent runs) is complete: commit `29484bc` by Claude
  Code, landed through `forge task integrate`; CI `36010816304` and `36011038882` are green. Every
  completed milestone through P2-M033 is tagged. Record every required approval, including
  `merge_protected_branch`, before `forge task launch` (finding 8; superseded by P1-M008, which
  records the merge approval after accept).
- P2-M032 (macOS daemon stop flake) is complete. Commit `e3c4bbe`, and four CI runs are green
  including macOS. **Closure ends
  with `scripts/tag-milestone <ID>` (check the dry-run subject reads "close ...") and pushing the tag**
  (AGENTS.md rule 14).
- P2-M029 is complete (commits `9e06c07`, `7e5c0c0`; CI `35971863878` and `35971879237` green).
  Agent runs print `agent-exit`, persist output to `.forge/evidence/<task>/`, and exit 1 on agent
  failure.
- P1-M007 (the first agent-built milestone, `6131508`) and P2-M027 (the bridge) are complete.
  Findings are in `docs/DOGFOODING.md`.
- Tasks meant to integrate through AgentForge need `--capability merge_protected_branch --approval
  merge_protected_branch` at creation. Never chain `worktree retire` after `integrate` with `;`.
- P2-M028 implementation commit: `2ffd59d`; CI `35969105365` (push) and `35969113717` are green.
  The gate now clears `GIT_*` before cargo and isolates linked-worktree target dirs.
- Push-triggered workflows now work on `cybercoretech/agentforge` (first seen on `f5c7a14`).
- The operator's `.forge/` in this checkout is gitignored. It holds the `claude-code` agent profile
  and a `workspace` gate (`./scripts/gate.sh full`).
- P2-M026 — Project site updates feed — is complete.
- P2-M026 implementation commit: `adaacc6`; dispatched CI `35966436681`, `35966450804`, and
  `35966453213` are green; Pages `35966439149` deployed.
- P2-M025 — Canonical repository identity — is complete.
- P2-M025 implementation commit: `e840557`; dispatched CI `35964790564`, `35964797514`, and
  `35964804756` are green, and Pages run `35964788019` deployed. Push-triggered workflows still do not
  fire on the new repository; dispatch `AgentForge CI` (and `AgentForge Pages` for site changes)
  with `gh workflow run ... --ref main`.
- External docs now exist: Wiki page `src/orchestration/agentforge.md` and darknotes
  `Dev/Rust/AgentForge/AgentForge.md`. Keep both current with real work.
- P2-M024 — Daemon long-running requests — is complete.
- P2-M024 implementation commit: `5ef03f1`; dispatched CI `35964099187`, `35964105073`, and
  `35964110929` are green on all seven jobs. Push-triggered workflows did not fire on the new
  repository at closure time; use `gh workflow run 'AgentForge CI' --ref main` until they do.
- P1-M006 — Concurrent batch launch — is complete.
- P1-M006 implementation commit: `b54f47a`; exact CI `35962553757`, `35962575356`, `35962581675`,
  and `35962587949` are green on all seven jobs. `forge task launch-batch` runs disjoint ready tasks
  concurrently under a single state coordinator.
- P1-M005 — CI observation wiring — is complete.
- P1-M005 implementation commit: `f1edf54`; exact CI `35962029748`, `35962047802`, and
  `35962053963` are green on all seven jobs. `forge ci observe` records classified exact-SHA CI
  evidence through the reviewed `.forge/ci/provider.conf`; `scripts/ci-provider-github` is the
  reference provider.
- P1-M004 — Orchestrated gate evidence — is complete.
- P1-M004 implementation commit: `aa30746`; exact CI `35961539333`, `35961557663`, and
  `35961562338` are green on all seven jobs. Gates in `.forge/gates/` now run automatically after
  a successful agent in `forge run`, `forge task launch`, and the daemon paths, and a failing gate
  fails the task.
- P2-M023 — Bounded daemon lifecycle tests and CI job timeouts — is complete.
- Active plan: none (`.plans/ACTIVE` is intentionally absent between milestones).
- P2-M023 implementation commits: `1eb3b0f`, `4f5a45e`, `29bc804`; five exact CI runs on
  `29bc804` (`35961283620` push plus four dispatched repeats) are green on all seven jobs.
  Repaired: the Windows six-hour hang (500 ms readiness poll then an unbounded join), a stalled
  client wedging the daemon, a stop/restart lock race, macOS fixture-root collisions, and Windows
  delete-pending `Access is denied` during teardown. Every CI job now has `timeout-minutes`.
- P4-M003 implementation commit: `ba06cc0c77c187c4ca63f8735f3e507603e4d6af`; local
  `./scripts/gate.sh full` passed for implementation and closure checkpoints.
- P4-M003 adds `agentforge-scheduler::plan_remote_dispatch` with canonical task/worker ordering,
  readiness/path checks, explicit expiry, lease-generation evidence, worker-capacity enforcement,
  and all-or-nothing lease-book mutation. Eight focused scheduler tests pass. No network,
  process, daemon, CLI, authentication, persistence, cloud mutation, or remote execution authority
  was added; no remote CI run was requested.
- P4-M002 implementation commit: `82626529ff5cdb6ae0d63aeafa43c2fa0490a143`; local
  `./scripts/gate.sh full` passed for implementation and closure checkpoints.
- P4-M002 adds validated lease restoration and deterministic lease iteration in core plus a separate
  bounded, checksummed, atomically replaced `.forge/state/remote-leases.snapshot` through
  `agentforge-state::FileLeaseStore`. Recovery is explicitly `load -> expire_due(observed_at_ms) ->
  continue`; no clock is read during load, and task state remains independent.
- P4-M002 corruption, bounds, semantic-conflict, and restart-recovery tests pass. No network,
  daemon, CLI, authentication, cloud mutation, or remote execution authority was added; no remote
  CI run was requested.
- P4-M001 implementation commit: `2027608`; local `./scripts/gate.sh full` passed for the
  implementation and closure checkpoints, including workspace Clippy, tests, and documentation
  tests. The focused `agentforge-core` suite passed 29 tests.
- P4-M001 adds validated worker descriptors, deterministic capabilities, and an in-memory lease
  state machine. It intentionally adds no network, persistence, cloud mutation, remote command
  execution, or authentication authority.
- P3-M001 implementation commit: `07eafdf5851b32b92a392d7ab9f2465f71f5e860` in the standalone
  `cybercore-mission-control` repository; remote `main` resolves to the exact SHA.
- P3-M001 validation passed with Cloudflare Workers Types `5.20260921.1`, Wrangler `4.135.0`
  dry-run, local D1 migration, runtime/API smoke, durable audit evidence, and duplicate-nonce
  rejection. No production Cloudflare deployment or credential was used.
- P3-M002 implementation commit: `5da61c73e729d245edc356047353c2bd82842fcc` in the standalone
  `cybercore-mission-control` repository; exact GitHub Actions run `35599020205` is green for
  Worker TypeScript and Rust connector jobs.
- P3-M002 passed locked Rust formatting, check, seven connector tests, and Clippy gates. The
  connector is outbound-only, observation-only, credential-redacting, and has no command channel;
  no production deployment or real operator credential was used.
- P3-M003 implementation commit: `781590ce3769aacda21d95db267ca74d91022dfe` in the standalone
  `cybercore-mission-control` repository; exact CI `35601172176` is green across Ubuntu, macOS,
  Windows, and Worker TypeScript.
- P3-M003 adds version/build provenance, cooperative Ctrl-C shutdown, MIT licensing, inspected
  package metadata, platform CI, and a tag-gated checksummed release workflow. GitHub accepted the
  workflow definition; no release tag, production deployment, crate publication, or real credential
  was used.
- P3-M004 implementation sequence: `48863e8`, `d2029f1`, `c5d92b4`, `9533c51`, `e9b76c3`, and
  `4a435c1c6ac90f78986aa39c04235dae6552d8aa` in the standalone `cybercore-mission-control`
  repository; exact CI runs `35608217415`, `35611397659`, `35612605311`, and `35614113529` are
  green for their corresponding heads, with the final run green across Worker TypeScript and the
  Ubuntu/macOS/Windows Rust connector matrix.
- P3-M004 covers fail-closed environment preflight, disposable local migration/API/live-event smoke,
  protocol and negative-path tests, explicit staging/production boundaries, a staging-only manual
  dry-run workflow, and deployment/recovery/security documentation. No Cloudflare deployment,
  production credential, real account ID, or remote command authority was used.
- AgentForge closure commit `571c8d26724b479ca2e9e0019ca4a31b240d8744` has exact CI
  `35621709316` and Pages deployment `35621709313` green.
- P2-M022 prepared the `agentforge-platform` package without changing the private registry
  boundary. Metadata, license inclusion, explicit registry version requirements, and the opt-in
  offline archive preflight are now in place.
- P2-M022 plan-boundary amendment: `00e7b5c`.
- P2-M022 implementation commit: `5027f3b7d289d4efb07bbd6d768062ea82632147`; exact CI
  `35569143760` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows. The package preflight produced and inspected a 16-file archive; normal offline registry
  resolution still fails closed because internal crates remain unpublished.
- P2-M021 isolated the concurrent Windows daemon lifecycle test race without weakening lifecycle
  assertions. The foreground daemon tests now serialize only their listener ownership inside the
  test binary; unrelated tests remain parallel.
- P2-M021 implementation commit: `97401eb712923acf08c88b0c09a3cc830daad928`; exact CI
  `35567104109` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows. Twenty repeated local parallel daemon-test runs and the full local gate passed.
- P2-M020 selected `agentforge-platform` as the future end-user Cargo package identity while
  preserving the `forge`/`forged` binaries, internal crates, and GitHub release artifacts.
- P2-M020 implementation commit: `02cf453ab778c4c2aa9e44d0c83d9378b8ac142e`; exact CI
  `35562749505` is green across all seven jobs after the initial macOS temporary-root collision.
- P2-M020 closure commit: `6ff27045a32c22d8910f48cd07ef70e086f50f94`; closure CI `35565106069`
  is green on six jobs. Windows reproduced the known daemon teardown `PermissionDenied (Access is
  denied.)` infrastructure failure; no package-identity regression was observed.
- P2-M019 implementation commit: `caa37debdd89ea6035723749b52db7a02fba081d`; exact CI
  `35559168897` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Ubuntu, macOS, and
  Windows.
- P2-M019 closure commit: `b4d7f7c90b72154b81306f289b872e2d8f1cf248`; exact CI
  `35559471908` attempt 2 is green across all seven jobs after the initial Windows daemon teardown
  infrastructure failure passed on the failed-job rerun.
- P2-M019 keeps all workspace crates private, documents the occupied crates.io names, and preserves
  GitHub binary distribution; no package publication, rename, yank, or owner-transfer request was
  made.
- P2-M018 implementation commit: `d6856e2`; exact CI `35555122531` is green across repository
  policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and Windows after the failed-job rerun.
- P2-M018 Pages deployment: exact workflow `35555122547` is green for the implementation SHA.
- P2-M018 closure commit: `cc2a6b2`; exact closure CI `35555830628` and Pages deployment
  `35555830619` are green for that exact closure SHA.
- The README now carries current alpha status, explicit safety/authority limitations, a safe
  first-run checklist, and detailed failure inspection guidance. The public Pages CTA opens a
  bounded local README dialog and the GitHub About homepage points to the live site.
- P2-M016 implementation commits: `b8eaff7`, `e92d9e7` (portable Windows protocol-fixture repair);
  exact CI `35551842104` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS,
  and Windows after the macOS temporary-root collision passed on the failed-job rerun.
- P2-M016 closure commit: `63513a6`; exact closure CI `35552143595` is green across repository
  policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- P2-M016 plan: `.plans/P2-M016-daemon-task-launch-parity.plan.md` — completed with
  `forge daemon launch` for direct executables and named profiles. It reuses the foreground launch
  preparation seam, keeps `daemon run` compatibility, and preserves explicit acceptance, review,
  integration, and retirement boundaries.
- P2-M017 implementation commit: `cae1563`; exact CI `35553651412` is green across repository
  policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and Windows after the Windows daemon teardown
  test passed on the failed-job rerun.
- P2-M017 Pages deployment: exact workflow `35553651453` is green for the same implementation SHA;
  the public site is live at `https://cybercoretech.github.io/agentforge/`.
- P2-M017 closure commit: `96e02c3`; exact closure CI `35553972640` and Pages deployment
  `35553972643` are green for that exact closure SHA.
- P2-M017 Pages workflow repair: `7d2b45b`; exact CI `35554310599` and Pages deployment
  `35554310590` are green, and the deployment environment URL is now a valid GitHub expression.
- P2-M017 Pages workflow repair closure: `24d1571`; exact CI `35554451233` and Pages deployment
  `35554451229` are green for the exact closure SHA.
- P2-M017 plan: `.plans/P2-M017-agentforge-github-pages.plan.md` — completed with the static
  forge-rail landing page, bounded Pages workflow, ADR, README discovery link, and preserved mockup.
- P2-M015 implementation commit: `8992da820162e3bd410841dd8eeddd8e5f04a935`; exact CI
  `35549918749` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows.
- P2-M015 closure commit: `5ce50c9`; exact closure CI `35550083171` is green across repository
  policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- P2-M015 plan: `.plans/P2-M015-real-project-orchestration-pilot.plan.md` — completed with a
  foreground `forge task launch` path that composes exact-base worktree preparation, readiness and
  approval preflight, bounded process execution, durable worktree observation, and explicit recovery.
- P2-M014 implementation commit: `b0cbdc810a1835c9f27d9c064cd6646334fc4897`; exact CI
  `35548080732` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows.
- P2-M014 closure commit: `75031af0105cf5019e8f55751f77e375947bb443`; exact closure CI
  `35548238497` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows. The initial Windows teardown failure was classified as infrastructure/flaky and the
  failed job passed on rerun.
- P2-M014 plan: `.plans/P2-M014-safe-review-integration.plan.md` — completed with bounded review
  diffs, explicit merge approval/capability checks, serialized fast-forward-only integration,
  idempotent audit evidence, and preserved branches/worktrees.
- P2-M013 implementation commit: `c9809205cf5f5851b00d957332a35f732392ab66`; exact CI
  `35545010733` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows.
- P2-M013 closure commit: `5c086b1c011edc8ebfab8da646d3a6808b239e7e`; exact closure CI
  `35545183120` is green across repository policy, stable, MSRV, CLI smoke, Linux, macOS, and
  Windows.
- P2-M013 plan: `.plans/P2-M013-pty-foreground-agent-sessions.plan.md` — completed with explicit
  PTY-backed foreground sessions, raw terminal restoration, resize forwarding, bounded evidence,
  and fail-closed non-TTY behavior.

## Resume checklist

1. Read `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.
2. Read `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`.
4. Read `docs/WORKTREE_ISOLATION.md`.
5. Read ADR-0002 and ADR-0010.
6. Run `./scripts/project-status`.
7. If work resumes, draft and approve a new bounded plan before implementation; no milestone is
   currently active.
8. Never bypass repository hooks or gates.
9. Classify failures before repair.

## Completed P0-M005 work

P0-M005 established the task-owned Git worktree lifecycle:

- deterministic `agentforge/task/<task-id>` branches;
- deterministic `.forge/worktrees/<task-id>` paths;
- exact base commit resolution;
- authoritative `git worktree list --porcelain -z` inspection;
- task, path, and branch ownership checks;
- managed-only deterministic listing;
- tracked and untracked dirty-state detection;
- unresolved merge, rebase, cherry-pick, and revert detection;
- conservative non-forced retirement;
- task-branch preservation;
- no shell interpolation or routine destructive cleanup;
- isolated concurrent integration fixtures;
- ambient `GIT_INDEX_FILE` isolation for Git subprocesses.

Exact implementation CI run `35481590769` passed all four jobs for
`e302cdae8a6610be04ec244bcefa2eab7c768864`.

## P0-M007 work

P0-M007 added a standard-library-only gate engine with direct explicit executable/argument
configuration, cleared child environments, bounded concurrent raw output capture, timeout and
output-limit termination, ordered batch reports, and duplicate-name rejection. Its implementation,
closure, and post-merge CI are green. P0-M008 will add exact-SHA CI observation and conservative
failure classification before later audit and policy milestones.

P0-M008 added a standard-library-only exact-SHA CI observer with bounded direct-command execution,
strict versioned protocol decoding, stale/ambiguous evidence rejection, and conservative taxonomy
classification. Its implementation CI is green; closure, merge, and post-merge evidence remain.
